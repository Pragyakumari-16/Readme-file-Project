# Dynamic form field

 Add and remove the Another form field in the form.

 Step 1 (HTML Code):
 
The first thing we need to do is create our HTML File. I've only included three fields, two of them (Name and Email) are static and I make another Field dynamic, on which we will be performing the actions.After creating the files just paste the below HTML codes into this file. Make sure to save our HTML document with a .html extension, so that it can be properly viewed in a web browser.

Step 2 (CSS Code):

Next, we will create our CSS file. In this file, we'll style the form fields with CSS to make them look more presentable. This can include things like setting widths and heights, adding borders, and changing the font.This will give our dynamic form fields an upgraded presentation. Create a CSS file with the name of styles.css and paste the given codes into your CSS file. Remember that you must create a file with the .css extension.

tep 3 (JavaScript Code):

The final step in creating dynamic form fields using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is to add and remove form fields dynamically using JavaScript. JavaScript allows us to create dynamic and interactive elements on the website.Adding form fields with JavaScript is a straightforward process. First, we need to create a new form field element using the document.createElement method. Next, we need to set the properties of this element, such as its type, name, and value. Finally, we need to add the element to your form using the appendChild method.Removing form fields with JavaScript is just as easy as adding them. To remove a form field, we simply need to find the element you want to remove and use the removeChild method to remove it from the form.Create a JavaScript file with the name of script.js.
