# Dynamic form field

 Add and remove the Another form field in the form.

 Step 1 (HTML Code):
The first thing we need to do is create our HTML File. I've only included three fields, two of them (Name and Email) are static and I make another Field dynamic, on which we will be performing the actions.After creating the files just paste the below HTML codes into this file. Make sure to save our HTML document with a .html extension, so that it can be properly viewed in a web browser.
